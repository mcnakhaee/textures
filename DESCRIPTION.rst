~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Palmer penguins dataset by Allison Horst, Alison Hill, and Kristen Gorman was first made publicly available as an R package. The goal of the Palmer Penguins dataset is to replace the highly overused Iris dataset for data exploration & visualization.
Using this python package you can easily load the Palmer penguins into your python environment.


Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Size measurements, clutch observations, and blood isotope ratios for 344 adult foraging Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins observed on islands in the Palmer Archipelago near Palmer Station, Antarctica. Data were collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program.
