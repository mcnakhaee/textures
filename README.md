Textures (Text Features) is a python library that allows you to extract useful statistics and features from text data, find common patterns from  text input and clean your text data without searching for regular expressions on the Web. This library is heavily inspired by [the awesome textfeatures R package](https://github.com/mkearney/textfeatures) developed by [Michael W. Kearney](https://github.com/mkearney)
